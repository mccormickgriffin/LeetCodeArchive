We start with a guard to make sure the array is not of zero length. If it is we simply return 0.

Since the array is sorted we know that each element will only be seen with each of its other instances. We use a variable to store which number we are currently processing and one that points to the first place a new number should be swapped to. We iterate through the array checking for new values and swapping them and iterating the pointer when we find one.
