Because we have to remove the occurrences of val in nums in place we have to swap those elements of the array to the end. We use a helper method to find the next swap index because it is possible to have zero to many entries of val at the end of our working array each time we do a swap. We have a guard that checks if there is any logic to be done with swapping and if not return 0 or 1 depending on the value in the first element in nums. Then we loop through nums swapping elements each time we find val until our search overlaps with the next swap index. The number of values that we not val should then be equal to the next swap index plus one.
